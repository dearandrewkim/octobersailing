  <p>In this era of Whatsapp and Facebook messages where communication is instant and perhaps too easy, nothing beats a handwritten letter from a friend. A personal dedicated letter to you.</p>

<p>After hard day at work, before you enter inside your house you look inside your postbox and find an envelope addressed to you. Suddenly it feels like Christmas again. You carefully open the envelope. You marvel at their handwriting and how much effort has gone into writing a message to you. You read the letter again and again, until you memorise all the words and soak up the love. You feel the thickness and the texture of the paper. You run your fingers along the creases. You analyse the postal stamp and imagine the journey this envelope it took – from the moment your friend put the letter in a postbox, flying across the seas, to arrive at your doorstep.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where everyone took the time to write each other a personal handwritten heart-warming letter. How much happier would the world be?</p>

  <p>After 3 hours of driving from Sydney, 20 minutes of detour, 1 expensive speeding fine, I arrived in Kandos for Cementa - a biennial contemporary arts festival.</p>

<p>Contemporary art isn't about demonstrating technical mastery (although it could be). It's a medium to gain a new perspective on the world. Cementa has successfully faciliated this. The wide range of artworks explored diverse issues raging from current affairs to examining human emotions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/kandos_2.jpg" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>My favourite artwork from the festival. The artist made these colourful pompoms to deal with her partner’s cancer and death.</p>

<p><img src="/images/kandos_3.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
Rusting church bell.</p>

<p><img src="/images/kandos_4.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
Performance art or just a crazy person – I wasn't sure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/kandos_5.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
Protest against coal mining in regional NSW.</p>

<p><img src="/images/kandos_6.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
Beautiful view of Kandos.</p>

<p>See you again in two years Kandos – it feels like you'll be there unchanged.</p>

  <time>Apr  5</time>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Today I got off the train at Circular Quay and the harbour was covered with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog#Types">advection fog</a>.</p>

<p>It was surprising. Every single day when I get off the train to go to work, the first thing I usually see is the magnificent view of the Harbour Bridge. But today, I couldn’t see the Harbour Bridge behind the weirdly dense fog. Although a momentary illusion – it was extremely confusing for my eyes and my brain to comprehend. Conversation between my eyes and my brain went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Eyes:</strong> Brain, I don’t see the Harbour Bridge.</p>

  <p><strong>Brain:</strong> You’re not doing your job properly.</p>

  <p><strong>Eyes:</strong> Are you kidding? I see the ferries, the harbour, the buildings, the fog, but no Harbour Bridge. Harbour Bridge must have disappeared.</p>

  <p><strong>Brain:</strong> But how could it disappear? It’s just behind the fog, don’t be silly.</p>

  <p><strong>Eyes:</strong> If it’s there, then why can’t I see it? The fog can’t be that massive to cover the whole bridge, can it?</p>

  <p><strong>Brain:</strong> I don’t know, I have no experience with fogs covering such a large object. But even if you can’t see it now, how could the giant bridge just disappear?</p>

  <p><strong>Eyes:</strong> Who is feeding the visual information of the physical world here? I am. And right now, I am visually informing you that I cannot see the Harbour Bridge. Think about the possibility that it could have disappeared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This internal conversation between my brain and my eyes lasted around 10 seconds before I started to see the bridge emerge from the fog.</p>

  <p>Q: Why be an artist?
A: Will being an artist help advance my career? Will I make money by being one? If not, I don’t have time to be an artist, I’m extremely busy.</p>

<p>If this is your response, then you need to listen to this TED talk by Young-ha Kim, a Korean post-modern writer who urges everyone to be an artist right now. There are English subtitles in this video.</p>

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aja-8sYjNaY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>If you don’t have the time to watch the video (although I strongly recommend that you watch it), here are three questions and answers which basically sums up his talk.</p>

<p>Q1: Why be an artist?
Because doing art makes you happy and it helps express yourself.</p>

<p>Q2: What are you going to do with it?
A: It doesn’t matter, you engage in artistic pursuits because it makes you happy.</p>

<p>Q3: Who should be artists?
A: Everybody. Everybody is born as an artist. Their inner artists are suppressed and needs to be released.</p>

<p>Art is not done to achieve some hidden ulterior motive. Art itself is the ultimate goal and the destination – to express yourself through a medium.</p>

<p>Young-ha Kim says that he’s asked his students in the past about what their happiest recollections were, For many of them their happiest moments were when they pursuing an artistic activity. They were either playing chopsticks on piano with their friends, or fiddling around with their analogue camera. Activities which had the sole purpose of entertainment, amusement and expressing themselves.</p>

<p>When I think about my happiest memory, it wasn’t when I got an award for my academic achievements. My happiest day for me was the launch night of my art exhibition showcasing my illustrations. I was extremely proud of my illustration and happy to be displaying it in public. To be honest, they don’t demonstrate some masterful artistic talent, but they are my honest thoughts expressed in a visual form.</p>

<p>In this digital age, there are alternative and easy ways to express yourself – facebook, instagram, twitter… However I don’t think it’s as fulfilling as a dedicating yourself to pursue an artistic activity. Instead of posting two or three line statuses on facebook why not write stories or start a blog? Instead of instagram-ing your foods, why not invest in a proper camera and travel for the sole purpose of taking photos?</p>

<p>Even if we don’t pursue art or design as full time professions, we need to release our inner artist through a range of medium - drawing, music, writing, and/or acting. Why? In order to express ourselves, be who we are, and be happy. How? Just do it.</p>

  <p>A couple of days ago, it hit me that I was spending way too much time on my phone. Whenever I had a spare moment, I was on Facebook rechecking the same news feed, rummaging for something that I may have missed. I was rechecking my email even though I knew that I did not miss anything.</p>

<p>I am an advocate of technology and smart phones, but we need to get our level of technology consumption right. We don’t need to be connected to the internet all the time. And we really don’t need to be instantly notified that someone has liked my Facebook profile photo while we are dining with friends. Or that Jetstar is having a “hot sale” for airplane tickets to Cairns from a years time when we are on the way to work.</p>

<p>What causes us to be addicted to our smartphones? Personally, I think it can be drilled down to what can be defined as “infinity” apps as described in this article. These are apps that gives us delightful (and deceiving) notifications and once its opened sucks us into a vortex of infinite (yet extremely useless) information.</p>

<p>That’s why I decided to remove all(*) of the distracting apps on my phone. I even considered switching to a dumb-phone – but I realised that I’m not that hardcore about this issue. And plus, I really do need some of the apps to make my life so much easier.</p>

<p>I plan to use my phone for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone – need</li>
  <li>Messages – need</li>
  <li>Maps – need</li>
  <li>Tripview (Sydney’s real time public transport information) – need</li>
  <li>Camera – need</li>
  <li>Browser (for occasional browsing) – need</li>
  <li>Spotify – sort of need</li>
  <li>Weather – need</li>
  <li>Todoist – will actually make me productive</li>
  <li>Evernote – sometimes really convenient and will actually make me productive</li>
  <li>Google Drive - sometimes really convenient and will actually make me productive</li>
  <li>Centrelink – much more convenient than logging in online</li>
  <li>Kakaotalk (temporarily) – will need to get rid of</li>
  <li>Whatsapp (temporarily) – will need to get rid of</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things I will not use it for</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mails – university and personal</li>
  <li>Facebook – I really don’t need to have access instantly.</li>
  <li>Facebook Messenger – If something is really urgent, they can call me</li>
  <li>Instagram</li>
  <li>Bank – I can access it on my browser</li>
  <li>Games</li>
  <li>Other useless apps</li>
</ul>

  <p>I took these photos when I did the Spit to Manly walk last year with my friend. We caught a bus from the city to the Spit and when got off to walk towards Manly we witnessed the drawbridge open and close. To allow the boats to pass through, the drawbridge must lift up which causes the never-ending stream of traffic to come to a grinding halt. Why not construct a bridge high enough so that the boats and cars can operate independently?</p>

<p>I think that this is a poetic infrastrcture. Poetic that this moving bridge has the potential to exercise significant control over all cars and boats. Like the sun and moon, this bridge operates as scheduled regardless of external factors. If your car is stuck behind the bridge, you just have to accept the situation and wait.</p>

<p>This is unlike waiting for the pedestrian or traffic lights to come on, something we encounter everyday and find extremely annoying. In those cases, we still feel as though we have some control. We jaywalk when possible and speed our cars before the light turns red. But once you’re on a drawbridge, we have no control. We have to wait for the bridge to slowly rise to the sky and come back down and then we can go about our business again. But until then, we just have to accept the momentary pause however inconvenient it may be.</p>

<p>Drawbridge is a physical intervention to remind ourselves we do not have the power to control everything in our lives. When the bridge rises, you can choose to be angry at the world, or learn to just accept the way it is and enjoy the view.</p>

  <p>Blogging = everybody in this world can read your post (incl. your past/current/future boss, colleagues and friends)</p>

<p>This article by Daily Post prompted me to think about how much of my personal life I should reveal on this particular blog. Before this one, I had a blog that I kept for 6 years. However because I kept blurring the lines of privacy, it was starting to complicate my personal life and so I decided to close that blog down.</p>

<p>And so for this blog I have created rules for myself to define what is acceptable and unacceptable on this blog.</p>

<p>Acceptable</p>

<p>Constructive critique of almost everything
Using acronym / pseudonym or alias to mention my friends
Unacceptable</p>

<p>Talk about my relationships
Religious opinions
Revealing my family and friend’s full names and personal lives
Bitching about my colleagues / friends / boss
With that said, I fully intend to express my thoughts in the most honest manner. My colleague once said to me that I should be the same person at work as I am at home (with there being boundaries of course). That is what I exactly intend to do here. If my future HR / employer / client reads my blog and doesn’t like what they read, then be it. If they do like what they read, then excellent… <em>tent fingers</em></p>

<p>Publicly posting on the internet is becoming second nature to everyone so people are starting to post all sort of non-sense on social media.</p>

<p>Additionally, I would like to publicly promise on this blog that I will not:</p>

<p>Post about how angry I was because my soy latte was not hot enough, or
Upload selfies trying on different clothes in dressing rooms, or
Congratulate myself for deleting friends on facebook or
Post the most boring attention seeking comments such as “i am bored”.
Instead, I would like to harness the power of internet to connect with other people through meaningful comments and interactions. And to achieve this, it is only necessary that the October Sailing be my finest curation of my carefully formulated thoughts.</p>

<p>I’m an optimist – I trust that the internet will be good to me if I use it right.</p>

  <p>Last Saturday I had a meeting in Leichhardt and on my way back home I came across a quiet little cafe called Organica – a raw food cafe* in Petersham. I could see that it was empty from outside but with the confirmation of high ratings in google maps, I went inside  and ordered a wrap and a coffee.</p>

<p>I sat on the window bar on a high wooden stool and enjoyed my raw (ie. untoasted) wrap and organic coffee. I looked outside through plants (what seems like weed) in glasses of water listening to the rain - I felt so serene.</p>

<p>I think these are the zen-moment that we look for in our busy lives. Moments where we hide and nestle in a small quiet space with noone bombarding you to buy or understand something. Don’t you think?</p>

  <li>Raw foodism is the dietary practice of eating only uncooked, unprocessed foods. (Wikipedia)</li>

  <p>Hello to my childhood friends and to strangers living on the other side of the planet. Welcome to October Sailing, my n-th attempt at blogging.</p>

<p>By following October Sailing, you will be boarding on my leaky (yet cosy) boat and joining me on my figure-out-the-meaning-of-life-love-and-everything-else journey through seas of random thoughts. So before you take the risk, it might be best to know you a little bit about me, your captain.</p>

<p>My name is Andrew Kim. I am a designer and nerd at heart and a very competent bossy-pants. I love starting side projects with friends or by myself (Check out Darganist, Urban Pancakes, Winter Sea, Dear Andrew Kim). I graduated from Bachelor of Engineering Honours and Bachelor of Design in Architecture at the University of Sydney at the end of 2014. I am currently working in the field of Project Management and Sustainability for an Australian culturally significant building (see my linkedin to find out which building).</p>

<p>Here, I hope to write original content about design, architecture, engineering, sustainability, or anything which I think is worth blogging about. Writing a blog will help me think more deeply about the issues, clarify my thoughts and improve my writing skills.</p>

<p>Living in this internet era is extremely exciting because it has essentially removed geographical boundaries that were once present. We can now express our thoughts online and these can travel across countries and continents. And because I’m an optimist and a believer in the internet, I hope to and believe that I will meet like-minded people from all around the world through this blog.</p>

<p>Ahoy, welcome aboard.</p>
