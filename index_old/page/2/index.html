  <time>Dec 21</time>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>I designed and printed Christmas card in the style of "Dear Andrew Kim" to everybody in the office. I did this because 1) to show that I am also a freelance designer outside of work (marketing) and 2) I thought it would be a thoughtful action and people would appreciate it. Okay, fine. And 3) I wanted to be slightly more liked.</p>

<p>So I ended up writing around 40 Christmas cards for everybody in our office. I wrote it to people that I talk to everyday and to those I've only talked to a couple of times. I thought it would be a quick exercise. I was wrong. It took solid 3-4 hours to come up with a personal message to each people that I was writing a card to.</p>

<p>However, it was definitely worth the investment of time and money. I thought that people would just say "thank you" and carry about with their work. However it was incredible to see how much of an effect these Christmas cards had on people. I truly felt the power of words then. Even the director of the portfolio that I work in came up to me to personally thanked me and also told me that it made his day.</p>

<p>I tried to address two things for each message that I wrote to make it meaningful and personal.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Why does this person inspire you?
For example: They are hardworking, or they have a lot of life experiences</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is a positive thing you notice about them?
For example: They make them laugh</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any memory that you share together even if its trivial?
For example: They were friendly and approachable when I first met them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Also don't be afraid to be honest and meaningful. To the director of Building, I told him that he is the most liked and respected person in the organisation and that I learn something new every time I talk to him. To my manager, I told him that he is amazing at what he does and he inspires me to work harder.</p>

<p>Maybe because I am surrounded by such positive and inspiring people that I found it easier to write a meaningful message to each of them.</p>

<p>I think occasions like Christmas and birthdays shouldn't be used to exchange useless gifts that just adds clutter to your house. Use this occasion to say thank you and talk about the positive things that you've always been wanting to say.</p>

  <h2><a href="../../../blog/2015/why-i-m-choosing-project-management/">Why I'm choosing project management</a></h2>
  <time>Dec  6</time>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>I thought I always wanted to be an architect because I like to make things and draw stuff. But I also love maths and physics and I'm proud to say I was very good at maths in high school. So once I graduated from high school, University of Sydney announced a combined bachelor's degree in architecture and engineering and this seemed to be the perfect degree for me. I applied and was fortunate enough to get into the course.</p>

<p>After 5 years of intensely studying, I was able to finally finish my degree last year. Even upon finishing, I was still certain that I wanted to be an architect. So I began my Masters of Architecture straight away - why waste time?</p>

<p>Starting of this year, I worked 4 days a week whilst studying 2 days a week for Masters of Architecture. But I absolutely hated this degree. I was completely demotivated by the end of the first semester and decided to defer the second semester.</p>

<p>I took leave from work during my semester break and travelled to the US for four weeks. I thought it would clear my negativity and motivate me to continue again. But I realised my complete lack of enthusiasm of finishing this degree was unwavering. I could not bring myself to continue to do the same thing that I was doing for the last five years - staying up all night trying to draw random things only to completely change everything the next day. Having pointless theoretical discussions about how architecture is everything and shapes the world (which clearly is not). Dreaming about what it would be like to be the next Le Corbusier. Making boxboard models only to throw them in the bin at the end of the semester.</p>

<p>I wanted more out of life and I didn't want to study something that I did not enjoy.</p>

<p>Whilst I was studying for my masters, I started working in the project management team within my workplace. I thought I would just be gaining valuable experience for my architecture career. However the more and more I worked in this area, the more attractive this career path became.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to switch career path to project management instead of pursuing architecture. I am unsure whether to pursue Masters of Project Management or pursue a Certificate IV, but I want to continue my education to progress on this career path.</p>

<p>The following are some of the main reasons to justify this decision:</p>

<p>Why project management.</p>

<h2 id="i-like-to-design-but-more-than-anything-i-like-making-things-happen-and-i-believe-i-have-what-it-takes-to-be-a-project-manager">1. I like to design. But more than anything, I like making things happen. And, I believe I have what it takes to be a project manager.</h2>
<p>I am able to think creatively as evidenced by my architectural design skills and my side projects. I have the technical knowledge from my engineering education. I also am bloody good at organising things to make things happen which can be seen through the leadership roles that I've taken at university societies.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-to-work-and-live-with-a-purpose">2. I want to work and live with a purpose.</h2>
<p>I want to play a crucial role in delivering big, interesting and creative projects and that's the beauty of project management - that I can, with enough experience. I don't want to be designing houses for one rich person to enjoy, or be pigeonholed to just do the CAD work.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-to-deliver-projects-in-a-diverse-range-of-industries">3. I want to deliver projects in a diverse range of industries.</h2>
<p>I want to deliver building infrastructure. I want to launch tech softwares. I also want to be capable of providing strategic direction in a company.</p>

<h2 id="i-like-to-be-responsible-and-be-given-autonomy-for-projects">4. I like to be responsible and be given autonomy for projects.</h2>
<p>I like delivering things from start to finish as evidenced in my side projects. I want to be a leader.</p>

<h2 id="salary-for-project-managers-are-very-good">5. Salary for project managers are very good.</h2>
<p>Well, at least compared to architects.</p>

<p>I'm excited about this new career path that I'm going to pursue. I'm willing to work hard for it. I am currently in a good position to learn a lot about project management. Hopefully, I'll be able to look back and say that I've worked hard to get to where I am and have had a happy, fulfilling life.</p>

  <p>This is an update to <a href="../passion-now-study-later">Passion now study later</a> post that I published 2 months ago.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p><strong>Coding</strong></p>

<p>After two months of extensive web developing, I was able to launch my <a href="http://dearandrewkim.com">http://dearandrewkim.com</a> website on my birthday! I built my website using Middleman, a ruby based static site generator.</p>

<p>I realised that I really enjoy front end web development. I think instead of "coding" back end, I'll shift my focus to "front end developement". Whilst I was redeveloping my website, I learnt how to use Bootstrap Framework, HAML, YAML, Markdown, Ruby on Rails syntax, jQuery and implement other javascript frameworks.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to try to learn more front end development tools such as Bower, Yeoman, Grunt and CSS preprocessors.</p>

<p><strong>Acting</strong></p>

<p>Two months ago,I signed up to a 10 week <strong>Meisner Technique</strong> acting course. All I can say is that I did not enjoy these classes. My aim as I highlighted in my <a href="../passion-now-study-later">first post</a> was to have fun, increase self confidence and develop my communication skills. These acting classes were aimed towards people who were serious about becoming actors (which I was not). I went to only four of them and stopped attending. I did not want to waste any more of my precious time after work to pursue something that I did not enjoy doing.</p>

<p>Instead, I signed up to a 8 week <strong>Improv Class</strong> course. I attended my first class last week and I absolutely loved it. This was what I was looking for - putting yourself out there in a supportive and fun environment. I am really looking forward to my improv class tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Cycling</strong></p>

<p>I bought a bike and it's honestly been the best investment I've made in a while. I commute to work with a bicycle and it has been so beneficial in many ways</p>

<ol>
  <li>I save money on transport</li>
  <li>I get exercise in the morning</li>
  <li>I am more awake at work</li>
  <li>I am able to get from point A to point B. I don't need to think about public transport and trackwork, and I don't have a car.</li>
  <li>It has been making me happier</li>
</ol>

<p>Straight away I got so addicted to cycling so last month, I took a week off work and cycled from Canberra to Sydney. It was very enjoyable and meditative. At times it was difficult especially when climbing never-ending hills, but overall, it was quite doable - especially for a person who have never cycle-toured before. I will be posting about this journey very soon.</p>

  <p>I’ve always kept a distance from my over controlling parents.</p>

<p>They usually make a lot of unreasonable request. When they do, I either respond aggressively or blankly ignore them. Sometimes, I turn the topic around and talk about their flaws.</p>

<p>They are controlling, but we are all imperfect. We are too proud to apologise for hurting each other.</p>

<p>We need to forgive, love and respect each other. But most importantly, we need to give each room to grow into the person we want to be.</p>

  <p>In my final two years as an undergraduate student, everyone kept telling me that it is very difficult to get a job by responding to advertisements. A lot of jobs aren't advertised - people get job through connections.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I began to see that this was true. This may be benefitial once you have established a good reputation for yourself within the field of your profession. However this was depressing for students who haven’t yet had the chance step into the professional world. It was infuriating to see some students in our year had already secured amazing graduate jobs because their parents knew the CEO of some reputable company. Life of privileges.</p>

<p>To desperately create “connections” for myself, I cringingly forced myself to attend many “networking events”. During university after guest lectures, I went up to lecturers to thank them for their talk, with a tiny hope that they would remember me. I also emailed my resumes to numerous architecture and engineering companies with cover letters why I would like to work for them. All of these failed.</p>

<p>I’m now a working professional and there have been a couple of students who have contacted me so far. One of them wanted help with their engineering thesis and another student wanted to have a chat to learn more about the team that I work in. He also wanted some advice on how he can get a job here. I began to see it from the other side of the table now and realised that I was very reluctant to reply to the second message.</p>

<p>Before I explain my reasons for being reluctant, I congratulate and appreciate their efforts in contacting me at all. I am more than happy to tell them about my experiences, how I got my current job (which was not through networking) and tips on how to get a job here. However, I made it clear that I do not have the power nor the influence to hire them and so they should not be expecting any jobs out of this. And honestly, I do not want the power to.</p>

<p>After thinking about why I was very reluctant to reply to the second email, I realised that everything boiled down to one thing - the writer’s intention. The tone of the email suggested that they weren't actually interested in learning about the things I that do. It suggested more that they were hoping to get a job out of the meeting. But that’s completely fair enough – I’ve been there and done that.</p>

<p>However what annoyed me the most was that there was an expectation that I should vouch for them. This is despite knowing absolutely nothing about the person and never having met them in real life.</p>

<p>My architectural studio tutor once told me that she hates being too invested in tutorial groups because people suck up to her in the hope for better marks. I understand what she means now. I have been to a few networking events and my general observation is that people aren’t genuinely interested in you or what you do. The whole purpose of "networking" is to use each other as stepping stone to advance their careers.</p>

<p>I understand that finding a graduate job is extremely hard, especially in architecture or engineering nowadays . I have no other advice but to keep trying. And once you've got your foot in the professional world, my advice is to meet people and develop professional connections not because you can use others as stepping stones to further your career but because you share the same passion.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of my US trip, I was excited to come back to Sydney.</p>

<p>I was motivated to change my lifestyle and pursue activities that I’ve always wanted to do. So I decided to defer my studies in Masters of Architecture for this semester whilst continuing to work four days a week. With three days a week free and a decrease in stress level, I’m going to invest my energy into activities that really interests me right now – coding, acting and cycling.</p>

<p><strong>Coding</strong></p>

<p>I’m learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails because</p>

<ol>
  <li>I want to create a start-up in the future</li>
  <li>I think I’ll be good at it</li>
  <li>I have this weird idea that it is some kind of a meditative activity – sitting in a cafe, listening to music and figuring out little problems, sort of like sudoku.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I have been learning bits of Ruby and Ruby on Rails and like everyone says, I find the language very clean. But let's not jump to conclusions - it is still <em>very, very</em> hard. My short term aim is to renew my dearandrewkim.com website. Then if I feel confident enough with the language, I'll try to create a fun start-up and transform my stupid ideas into reality (well at least in the digital world).</p>

<p><strong>Acting (enrolled)</strong></p>

<p>I enrolled in an acting school in Redfern and will be starting in a couple of weeks. I’ve always wanted to try it as a self-development activity to gain confidence and improve my communication skills. However, who knows? Maybe I'll discover my talent for crying on stage causing everyone else to cry? Then maybe I'll pack my bags and fly to Hollywood to pursue acting?</p>

<p><strong>Cycling (Not yet cycling but very determined.)</strong></p>

<p>I am a firm believer of designing cities to be more people and bike friendly. However I’ve never been able to practise what I preach because cycling in Sydney is in fact terrifying – the drivers are crazy and the roads are thin and hilly. I think that it’s easier to cycle in New York because the cars are often gridlocked, the terrain is quite flat and pedestrians really do own the roads.</p>

<p>Then I realised what has been preventing me from cycling were just excuses. If I tried hard enough, I think I'll be able to find a safe route when I cycle to work.</p>

<p>I will be purchasing my bike sometimes this week. But until I actually start riding and see how it is, I will be screaming loud and proud that cities should be built for people not cars.</p>

  <p>I am back in Sydney after four weeks of travelling in the US. Before I left, I decided that this time, I would travel with just my blue backpack – and mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Excluding the clothes I was wearing (1 t-shirt, 1 long sleeve collared shirt and 1 pants), I packed into the bag the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 other tshirts</li>
  <li>1 sleeping tshirt</li>
  <li>1 pants</li>
  <li>1 sleeping pants</li>
  <li>5 undies</li>
  <li>5 pairs of socks</li>
  <li>laptop</li>
  <li>camera</li>
  <li>toiletries</li>
  <li>New York guide book</li>
  <li>“Just Kids” by Patti Smith Book</li>
  <li>1 Kindle</li>
  <li>electronic cables (mobile phone charger, laptop…)</li>
  <li>passport etc</li>
</ul>

<p>And that was it.</p>

<p>Carrying only the essentials made my travels extremely easy. At all times, I knew exactly where my valuables were. And because I had to consider the limited space inside my bag, it also made me buy very little. All I bought for myself was one black ceramic mug in New York (to be added to my ceramic collection), a small black messenger bag, a poetry book and postcards. No clothes!</p>

<p>I brought back along with me the same backpack I took and a new messenger bag. We really don’t need a lot to travel with.</p>

  <h2><a href="../../../blog/2015/goodbye-facebook/">Goodbye Facebook</a></h2>
  <time>Jun 26</time>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Goodbye Facebook – you have been fun but I’m moving on.</p>

<p>A month ago, I decided to say goodbye to Facebook for good after being inspired by a friend who deactivated his Facebook earlier on. We have come to a point where everybody you know has a profile on Facebook. I think the idea of being connected with people all around the world is exciting. But I began to question myself up to what point do we need to be connected and know about people’s lives?</p>

<p>Here are the list of reasons why I decided to deactivate Facebook.</p>

<h3 id="i-was-being-addicted-to-facebook-without-knowing-it">I was being addicted to Facebook without knowing it</h3>

<p>Every time I went on Facebook, I thought I was rewarding myself from hard work and that I wasn’t spending much time on it. This was untrue. Although my intention was to scroll through the news feed for only a few seconds, this turned into tens of minutes, dozen times an hour which you can imagine accumulates into a significant amount of time. The worst part of it was that after years of developing this habit, I felt the <em>need</em> to go on Facebook. It had become a habit – I would pull out my phone out of my pocket or turn on the computer just to check Facebook despite knowing there won’t be any notifications.</p>

<h3 id="i-was-beginning-to-feel-jealous">I was beginning to feel jealous</h3>

<p>I still think that being connected to your friends is a great idea – but I have reconsidered whether it should be through Facebook. My personal opinion is that Facebook has become a self-validating platform. People share their achievements and it is expected that if their friends really did care about them, it would translate into a number of likes. Let me be clear, I am happy for my friends who graduated, or got a dream job, or are getting married, etc. But I feel that it is unfair that we are expected to like goddamn everything on Facebook. And after a while, liking post about how everyone was off achieving amazing things, it was hard not to compare them to my own.</p>

<h3 id="people-were-getting-really-annoying">People were getting really annoying</h3>
<p>People post things on Facebook because they can satisfy both their boredom and the need for attention. However these statuses end up being usually just mindless crap. I’ve seen too many selfies taken in gym change rooms, too much whinging about customer service, too many food pics and too many heroic stories about themselves. I started to ask myself why I bother being part of this cycle by equally producing and consuming all this useless information.</p>

<h3 id="unhealthily-stalking-people">Unhealthily stalking people</h3>

<p>Facebook is great for stalking. I admit, I’ve looked up embarrassing amount of people that I just met after finding out their names. And it has been really fun to get to know about a person on this level of detail. But the more important question is – why do I need to know all this information? Vice versa, would I want someone I just met to know everything about myself? Do I want my internet persona to really represent who I am?</p>

<p>However, there were few simple reasons which held me back from deactivating from earlier</p>

<h3 id="being-not-invited-to-events">Being not invited to events.</h3>
<p>However if my friend really wanted me to come to an event I would like to think that they would personally invite me if I'm off facebook.</p>

<h3 id="my-facebook-pages-of-my-projects">My Facebook pages of my projects</h3>
<p>But then I decided that Facebook marketing was pretty ineffective based on my previous experience. If I were to ever come back on Facebook to market my projects, then I think I'll create an account just for that purpose only.</p>

<h3 id="memories-in-photos-and-conversations">Memories in photos and conversations</h3>
<p>But then I realised I could download them all!</p>

<p>Before I deactivated, I made sure I did the following:</p>

  <li>Download all my data</li>
  <li>Message everyone (that I cared about) that I will be deactivating facebook. I left my number and email should they wished to contact me.</li>
  <li>Reassign administrator rights of my Facebook pages to a fake profile that I created.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that was it. Simple.</p>

<p>It’s been a month since I deactivated and I can honestly say that I feel a lot happier and focused. Looking back, I don’t know what I was on about when I thought that it was such a big decision. I thought it would be really hard without it but honestly it hasn't been difficult at all.</p>

<p>Let’s be connected without being a showoff or a stalker.</p>

  <p>We all want to be praised and be acknowledged for our hard work. I am slowly learning that perhaps love and respect for ourselves comes purely within. However it is easier said than done – of course we want to feel validated by others with positive comments.</p>

<p>I have a tendency to let a small comment made by others stick inside my head for days, months and years – like spilled wine on a shirt. I like to think that there are three approaches to situations like this.</p>

<p><strong>1. Wash it away as soon as you detect it.</strong></p>

<p>As soon as I realise that I am being affected by the negative comment, I need to learn to accept it or recognise that it is simply not true. I then need brush it off and move on with life.</p>

<p><strong>2. Ignore it. Then when you try to wash it off, it's too late.</strong></p>

<p>Clearly, this is the worst approach to a negative comment. Sometimes, I think that a negative comment didn’t affect me at all. However once I realise that I am actually constantly thinking about it, it’s too late. It’s engrained in my mind and it’s harder to talk myself out of it.</p>

<p><strong>3. The wine is now forever part of your shirt.</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps that comment was correct after all. I might be hurt by it for a while. But maybe I have to learn to accept it the way it hurts me. But instead of it being a burden on my shoulder, I need to let it be a crucial mark and a reminder to be better.</p>

<p>Or alternatively, let the wine turn your white shirt into red and let that be your new shirt colour.</p>
