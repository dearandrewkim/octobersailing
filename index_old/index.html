  <p>Last Saturday, I attended a tea meditation retreat at the Nan Tien Temple near Wollongong by myself. It was an incredible experience. I felt I learnt so many lessons that I could apply in my life.</p>

<p>In this retreat, we learned a little bit about how to earnestly enjoy tea. How? It's simply about being in the present and using all your senses and enjoying the moment without any judgements. From my research, it appears that the tea ceremony that we did is a simplified version of the Gongfu tea ceremony.</p>

<p><strong>Steps</strong> (That I've been taught)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare the tea set and have hot water in the flask ready</li>
  <li>Put little bit of tea into the cup. Hear the tea tinkle against the ceramic. Examine the colour and the shape. Smell the tea leaves.</li>
  <li>Put the tea into the teapot</li>
  <li>Pour boiling water into the teapot</li>
  <li>Recite a mantra whilst it brews</li>
  <li>Once it is ready, pour the tea into the tea pitcher</li>
  <li>From the tea pitcher, put it into your tea cup</li>
  <li>Smell the tea, feel the warmth, examine the colour. Notice your urge to drink the tea.</li>
  <li>Drink and enjoy the tea.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note to self</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Be present (a lot harder said then done)</li>
  <li>Do this every morning - it will change your life</li>
  <li>Do all things with intention</li>
  <li>Habit helps to master things (for example if I complain at home all the time, I become excellent at complaining)</li>
  <li>Have simple yet structured discipline</li>
  <li>It's about quality not quantity of tea</li>
  <li>Buy good tea leaves and a pretty Chinese teapot to really enjoy the experience</li>
  <li>Whilst meditating, have a good posture. Be relaxed but awake and focused</li>
  <li>Enjoy the experience. Do not be quick to judge as there is no good or bad nor mistakes.</li>
  <li>Notice the transformation of the tea leaves after brewing - an example of a constant change in life</li>
  <li>Investigate whether I could do Traditional Korean / Chinese stay in the future</li>
</ul>

  <p>I am slowly beginning to realise I have unrealistically high expectations from people.</p>

<p>I need to accept you for who you are with all your flaws.
And I need to you to accept me for who I am.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don't try to steer the boat. 
Don't open shop for yourself. Listen. Keep silent. 
You are not God's mouthpiece. Try to be an ear, 
And if you do speak, ask for explanations.”

  <p>Actually, I think I had it all wrong.</p>

<p>I was writing this blog thinking I was like Kanye and that I would miraculously generate millions of followers because I was so awesome.</p>

<p>I need to let go of this expectation, dream, ambition, or whatever you call it.</p>

<p>I looked back at my first entry and it was clear that through this blog, I wanted to connect with people. But because of this pressure, I kept procrastinating on writing more blog entries (shameful 7 months of no entry beginning of this year 2016)</p>

<p>I think this transcript from Grace and Frankie perfectly sums up my feeling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frankie: Oh, God, well, I tried to "join the conversation," Mike, like you and I talked about, but nobody is talking back to me.</p>

  <p>Mike: You know, Frankie, the Internet's not like a real conversation. It's just a bunch of people screaming into the void. For a real conversation, you need…</p>

  <p>Frankie: I know, I know, Mike.</p>

  <p>Mike: You… you need real people.</p>

  <p>Frankie: Right?</p>

  <p>Mike: Right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you go. I need to let go of the expectation that I'll be a phenomenon and will create loyal followers. Just be me, just write about my feelings, because who's going to read it anyway? Of course, I'll still need to be careful on what I write just in case my entries don't backfire at me.</p>

<p>But I need to write for me. Not so that people will like me or for others to read.</p>

<p><strong>So note to self: Write without any expectations. Write for myself. For my sanity.</strong></p>

  <p>I can't always be the good guy.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I need to put myself first instead of other people's feeling.
Sometimes, I need to deal with my own problem not others.</p>

<p>I have the right to feel my emotions.
I have the right to take my time.</p>

<p>I will not compromise on these two things and I won't apologise.</p>

  <p>You say you're sorry for everything, but what does this even mean? It's a blanket statement, it doesn't address the root of the problem nor does it help you to change.</p>

<p>You always seem to forget your intent of your apology. And people only forget things if it had no meaning to them.</p>

<p>But am I being a hypocrite? Do I say things that I don't mean?</p>

<p>If my words and my heart don't align, how can I change how I feel? Or, how should I say how I really feel?</p>

<p>We've been friends for a long time but that doesn't mean that I'm immune by all the hurtful things that you've done. I'm still hurt by you. And I've hurt you too I know.</p>

<p>I can pretend like there's nothing wrong. But I think that we obth change and when we're both ready, we can be friends again.</p>

  <p>When I was 10 years old, my parents bought me a Siamese Fighting fish. I had it for five months and one day, we left the jar in direct sunlight and unfortunately it died.</p>

<p>Last Sunday, I bought myself a Siamese Fighting fish again. As I am planning to stay at my new place that I'm in for a long time and I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to have a pet fish which is easy to maintain.</p>

<p>I've been dribbling about the idea of having an aquarium for a few months now. I researched online and I bought a My Self Cleaning Tank Jar, which is a tank when water is poured from the top, the dirty water at the bottom gets pushed out through a nozzle. It has mixed reviews on the internet - some praising it's ingenious design whilst others horrified by the lack of space. Nevertheless, I thought I might give it a go so I bought this on ebay and it arrived and I set it up. I went to Marrickville Aquarium store and I bought a Siamese Fighting fish along with water conditioner and fish food. I took it home, floated the fish bag for an hour and released it into my tank. I went to my garden, picked some plants and just put it into the tank for some decoration.</p>

<p>I named it Finn.</p>

<p>I've had Finn for a week now and I am constantly fascinated by it. I have it next to my desktop and I watch it intensely. I watch it swim, interact with its surrounding. It's funny because the day after I bought my fish, I had to go back to my parents home for the night and I was constantly worried for my fish whether it would have jumped out.</p>

<p>Finn, thanks for keeping me happy and I hope that I'll make you happy too.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>My fish got stuck under a rock and it died.. I'm sorry Finn.</p>

  <p>I grew up in a very conservative Christian household and my parents wanted to protect and shape me according to their values.</p>

<p>After attending the same church for 18 years I finally had it. My values were very different to the one churches endorsed. I told my parents I'll not be going to that church anymore but I ensured them I'll at least attend a different church. And I really did want to continue to explore religion, church, faith and God. This happened three months ago.</p>

<p>So the next day I googled "progressive churches" and found one in the Sydney CBD. I attended the service and I loved it. They weren't trying to teach outdated dogma or instil guilt. They welcomed everyone no matter what they believe in and where they are in their spiritual journey.</p>

<p>I have still a lot to learn about Christianity, the Bible and theology in general. But as I think, if religion doesn't help us live our life, then it has no meaning. I attended a seminar by Val Webb, a progressive theologian and emphasised the need for contextual theology - that religion and religious beliefs are always contextual and Christianity has to be adapted to our context so that it remains relevant to the modern society and our ever expanding knowledge of the world. We don't have to accept the Bible as the infallible truth, because it isn't. We don't have to believe in the salvation story.</p>

<p>I realised that some people are just happy to told what to believe in. Some people love being part of the institution. And there are others who cannot accept everything they are told to believe. And there are rest who don't even try to listen.</p>

<p>When I was young, I was quite happy to be told what to believe in because I thought the person who were preaching the messages had "obviously" studied the Bible and interpreted it correctly. Yet later on I realised, this is religion, not science. It can be interpreted in so many ways - literally or metaphorically. We can cherry pick verses to support our argument. We can use this "higher" authority to tell people that they know the Truth - yet there is no Universal Truth.</p>

<p>I've been reading Val Webb's book and will finish this entry with a quote from Natalie Goldberg's book that she cited in the introduction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Remember, whatever you do, the one true test of a religion. Ancestor's history doesn't matter - what matters is that it can help you here and now in your life."
- Natalie Golberg</p>

  <h2><a href="../blog/2016/stress-and-anxiety/">Stress and anxiety</a></h2>
  <time>Jul 28</time>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>I have been working full time for about a year now and it has been exhausting and stressful. My working life routine goes something like this: I wake up, shower, rush to work and then I jump into work for 8 hours without noticing time has flown by. I come back home, cook myself some dinner and then sleep. I do this 5 times a week. Once this is over, it's suddenly the weekend and I spend my hard earned weekend by recovering from the exhausting week at work. Then suddenly it's Monday again.</p>

<p>I'm not complaining about my work because I really couldn't ask for more. I work normal office hours and only occasionally work overtime. The office is located in a very convenient place and the view from my office is quite amazing. I have great coworkers and my boss is great. I really love working for my organisation and I truly believe in it.</p>

<p>One thing that I can say is that it's such a complex place to work. For the projects that I am involved with, everything is constantly evolving and it's hard to keep a track of it all. My tasks are currently creeping up on me and it's not something I can just undertake because many of the tasks I need to do require coordination with others and approvals from managers.</p>

<p>I am slowly beginning to understand why managerial positions are paid higher - because it's just so stressful. I'm not even in such a high position and yet work is stressing me out. I don't even have kids to look after and I am exhausted by the end of each week.</p>

<p>What is my first step into the professional world teaching me? A big portion of the job is a mental game and that we must play it. We cannot let stress and anxiety win. We need to be efficient and productive at work, yet we cannot let work consume our lives. We cannot think that the world is going to end if we don't finish what we plan to do. We need to be the  one in charge of our workload and do it well. We need to be the one to prepare ourselves physically and mentally for the work day ahead. We need to be the one to check if we really like our jobs and if not take proactive measures to find one we like. We need to acknowledge that we are in a constant psychological battle or we will lose from stress and anxiety.</p>

<p>Instead of saying to myself "it's already Sunday night, I don't want to go to work tomorrow," I'm trying to say, "I'm excited for another challenging week at work". It's very unconvincing I know. But hopefully if I tell myself this ad nauseum - several times a day, everyday, I might actually end up believing it.</p>

  <p>My sister is leaving to the UK tomorrow for 5 years for her academic career. I am thrilled for her but I am only starting to realise that there may have been too many missed opportunities to get to know each other a bit more. So I have been trying to make up for the time lost over the past couple of weeks by spending some quality brother - sister time.</p>

<p>During one of the conversations, my sister told me that a lot of people have disappointed her. Why? I ask. Because nobody really cared that she is leaving. This includes people from church, a church we have been attending for the past 17 years. A lot of people came and went during that time, but when it is finally time for her to leave, there appeared to be noone who really cared.</p>

<p>I was devastated to hear this. How could she spend the past 17 years in Sydney and surrounded herself with such pathetic uncaring people?</p>

<p>What went wrong? I don't know but I know that it's not her fault. Although she could be critical at times, she is the most loyal, hard working and generous person I know. She didn't do anything wrong. Rather I think it was the circumstance that she was in pursuit of her academic career. For the past three years, she has been working on her PhD at home She went to university around once a week. She didn't have the chance to meet new people and didn't really question the people who surrounded her in her life.</p>

<p>In this modern society we're always pursuing our education, career and ultimately romantic love where we aspire to create a family of our own. But beyond these pursuits, one of the aims of life is to make meaningful human connection with others - whether it be romantic love, friendship love, or parental love. Life is worth it once we surround ourselves with people whom we love and love us. Although how important this may be, we don't really take the time to question the people who surround us everyday whether we have these meaningful connection with them.</p>

<p>So what does it mean to have meaningful connection?</p>

<p>From here on, I have decided that meaningful connection means this: <strong>A person who is able to reciprocate love.</strong> It doesn't matter whether they work in Google or don't yet have a job, completed their PhD or have only graduated high school. What we need are people who care.</p>

<p>So it is time to ask ourselves the people surround us everyday - our colleagues, high school friends, university friends, random hang out friends. The thing is, we might not realise it but we may not have a meaningful connection with these people - yet. We need to be ready to invest more love in these people and tell them that you do indeed care. But first, we need to determine whether they are worthy of our love. We need to ask ourselves these questions: <strong>Will they reciprocate the same love? Do they care about me, and do I care about them? If not, I think it's time to move on and find a new set of friends.</strong></p>

<p>I am happy that my sister will be starting a new chapter in life. From here one, I hope that we both try hard to find people worthy of love and make meaningful connections with them.</p>
