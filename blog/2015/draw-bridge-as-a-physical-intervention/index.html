    	<h2>Draw bridge as a physical intervention</h2>
    	<img class="img-responsive desaturate" src="../../../images/thespitbridge1.jpg" />
    <p>I took these photos when I did the Spit to Manly walk last year with my friend. We caught a bus from the city to the Spit and when got off to walk towards Manly we witnessed the drawbridge open and close. To allow the boats to pass through, the drawbridge must lift up which causes the never-ending stream of traffic to come to a grinding halt. Why not construct a bridge high enough so that the boats and cars can operate independently?</p>

<p>I think that this is a poetic infrastrcture. Poetic that this moving bridge has the potential to exercise significant control over all cars and boats. Like the sun and moon, this bridge operates as scheduled regardless of external factors. If your car is stuck behind the bridge, you just have to accept the situation and wait.</p>

<p>This is unlike waiting for the pedestrian or traffic lights to come on, something we encounter everyday and find extremely annoying. In those cases, we still feel as though we have some control. We jaywalk when possible and speed our cars before the light turns red. But once youâ€™re on a drawbridge, we have no control. We have to wait for the bridge to slowly rise to the sky and come back down and then we can go about our business again. But until then, we just have to accept the momentary pause however inconvenient it may be.</p>

<p>Drawbridge is a physical intervention to remind ourselves we do not have the power to control everything in our lives. When the bridge rises, you can choose to be angry at the world, or learn to just accept the way it is and enjoy the view.</p>
