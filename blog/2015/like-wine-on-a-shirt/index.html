    	<h2>Like spilled wine on a shirt</h2>
    <p>We all want to be praised and be acknowledged for our hard work. I am slowly learning that perhaps love and respect for ourselves comes purely within. However it is easier said than done – of course we want to feel validated by others with positive comments.</p>

<p>I have a tendency to let a small comment made by others stick inside my head for days, months and years – like spilled wine on a shirt. I like to think that there are three approaches to situations like this.</p>

<p><strong>1. Wash it away as soon as you detect it.</strong></p>

<p>As soon as I realise that I am being affected by the negative comment, I need to learn to accept it or recognise that it is simply not true. I then need brush it off and move on with life.</p>

<p><strong>2. Ignore it. Then when you try to wash it off, it's too late.</strong></p>

<p>Clearly, this is the worst approach to a negative comment. Sometimes, I think that a negative comment didn’t affect me at all. However once I realise that I am actually constantly thinking about it, it’s too late. It’s engrained in my mind and it’s harder to talk myself out of it.</p>

<p><strong>3. The wine is now forever part of your shirt.</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps that comment was correct after all. I might be hurt by it for a while. But maybe I have to learn to accept it the way it hurts me. But instead of it being a burden on my shoulder, I need to let it be a crucial mark and a reminder to be better.</p>

<p>Or alternatively, let the wine turn your white shirt into red and let that be your new shirt colour.</p>
