    <p>This is an update to <a href="../passion-now-study-later">Passion now study later</a> post that I published 2 months ago.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p><strong>Coding</strong></p>

<p>After two months of extensive web developing, I was able to launch my <a href="http://dearandrewkim.com">http://dearandrewkim.com</a> website on my birthday! I built my website using Middleman, a ruby based static site generator.</p>

<p>I realised that I really enjoy front end web development. I think instead of "coding" back end, I'll shift my focus to "front end developement". Whilst I was redeveloping my website, I learnt how to use Bootstrap Framework, HAML, YAML, Markdown, Ruby on Rails syntax, jQuery and implement other javascript frameworks.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to try to learn more front end development tools such as Bower, Yeoman, Grunt and CSS preprocessors.</p>

<p><strong>Acting</strong></p>

<p>Two months ago,I signed up to a 10 week <strong>Meisner Technique</strong> acting course. All I can say is that I did not enjoy these classes. My aim as I highlighted in my <a href="../passion-now-study-later">first post</a> was to have fun, increase self confidence and develop my communication skills. These acting classes were aimed towards people who were serious about becoming actors (which I was not). I went to only four of them and stopped attending. I did not want to waste any more of my precious time after work to pursue something that I did not enjoy doing.</p>

<p>Instead, I signed up to a 8 week <strong>Improv Class</strong> course. I attended my first class last week and I absolutely loved it. This was what I was looking for - putting yourself out there in a supportive and fun environment. I am really looking forward to my improv class tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Cycling</strong></p>

<p>I bought a bike and it's honestly been the best investment I've made in a while. I commute to work with a bicycle and it has been so beneficial in many ways</p>

<ol>
  <li>I save money on transport</li>
  <li>I get exercise in the morning</li>
  <li>I am more awake at work</li>
  <li>I am able to get from point A to point B. I don't need to think about public transport and trackwork, and I don't have a car.</li>
  <li>It has been making me happier</li>
</ol>

<p>Straight away I got so addicted to cycling so last month, I took a week off work and cycled from Canberra to Sydney. It was very enjoyable and meditative. At times it was difficult especially when climbing never-ending hills, but overall, it was quite doable - especially for a person who have never cycle-toured before. I will be posting about this journey very soon.</p>
